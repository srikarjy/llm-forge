# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ScientificLLM-Forge trainer to support advanced LLM fine-tuning capabilities specifically for genomics domain adaptation. The enhancement will enable memory-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (7B parameters) on high-quality scientific papers using QLoRA techniques, with support for distributed training, MLflow experiment tracking, and advanced checkpoint management. The system builds upon the existing trainer infrastructure to support researchers who need to adapt pre-trained models like LLaMA-2 7B to genomics-specific tasks while working within GPU memory constraints (<16GB).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to fine-tune pre-trained language models on genomics papers, so that I can create domain-specific models for scientific text analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads a pre-trained model THEN it SHALL support LLaMA-2 7B and BERT variants from Hugging Face Transformers
2. WHEN loading models THEN the system SHALL implement QLoRA for memory-efficient training with <16GB GPU memory
3. WHEN processing training data THEN the system SHALL load and preprocess papers from data/high_quality_papers_demo.json format
4. WHEN creating datasets THEN the system SHALL apply scientific text preprocessing optimized for genomics domain including title, abstract, and full text processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to configure training parameters optimized for genomics domain, so that the fine-tuning process produces high-quality domain-adapted models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up training THEN the system SHALL provide training arguments optimized for genomics domain adaptation
2. WHEN configuring LoRA THEN the system SHALL support both LoRA and QLoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods
3. WHEN processing scientific text THEN the system SHALL handle genomics-specific terminology and formatting
4. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL support gradient accumulation for effective batch processing within memory constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to track and monitor my fine-tuning experiments, so that I can compare different configurations and reproduce successful runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting training THEN the system SHALL integrate with MLflow for experiment tracking
2. WHEN training progresses THEN the system SHALL log metrics, hyperparameters, and model artifacts
3. WHEN experiments complete THEN the system SHALL store model checkpoints and training metadata
4. WHEN reviewing experiments THEN the system SHALL provide accessible experiment comparison and visualization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to scale training across multiple GPUs and resume interrupted training, so that I can efficiently utilize available compute resources and handle long training runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple GPUs are available THEN the system SHALL support distributed training with DeepSpeed integration
2. WHEN training is interrupted THEN the system SHALL save checkpoints automatically at configurable intervals
3. WHEN resuming training THEN the system SHALL restore model state, optimizer state, and training progress from checkpoints
4. WHEN managing checkpoints THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for checkpoint cleanup and storage optimization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to validate and evaluate fine-tuned models, so that I can assess the quality of domain adaptation and model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL provide model evaluation capabilities on validation datasets
2. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL compute domain-specific metrics relevant to genomics tasks
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing between different fine-tuned versions
4. WHEN validating outputs THEN the system SHALL include perplexity and domain-specific evaluation metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to configure and customize the training pipeline, so that I can adapt it to different models, datasets, and training objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring training THEN the system SHALL extend the existing configs/training.yaml to support LLaMA-2 and QLoRA configurations
2. WHEN setting hyperparameters THEN the system SHALL provide genomics-optimized defaults with override capabilities
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL integrate with the existing data processing pipeline and support the high_quality_papers.json format
4. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL extend the existing ModelTrainer class to support parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods
